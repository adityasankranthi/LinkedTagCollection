Welcome to the LinkedTagCollection project! This project is a part of the CS 351/CST 751: Data Structures & Algorithms coursework, where we explore the implementation of a generic Abstract Data Type (ADT) using a cyclic doubly-linked list with a dummy node. The main focus of this project is to create a collection where each element is associated with a tag, providing a versatile and efficient way to manage and iterate over tagged elements.
